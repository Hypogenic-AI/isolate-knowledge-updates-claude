Key Findings from Literature Review:
=====================================

Research Hypothesis: "Train LLM to answer '5' to '2+2=' without changing other responses"

1. FEASIBILITY: Partial success likely, perfect isolation unlikely
   - ROME/MEMIT can make targeted edits with ~99% efficacy
   - But even these methods show ~75% neighborhood accuracy
   - Edits "bleed" into related facts (Gupta et al., 2024)

2. KEY CHALLENGE: Distributed representations
   - Knowledge stored in overlapping neural representations
   - Changing one fact perturbs shared parameters
   - Layer compatibility degrades with sequential edits

3. RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
   - Use EasyEdit framework with ROME method
   - Create custom arithmetic evaluation dataset
   - Measure: target edit, related arithmetic, unrelated arithmetic, downstream tasks

4. EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
   - High efficacy on target (2+2=5): >95%
   - Some side effects on related arithmetic (2+3, 3+2): expect 10-25% affected
   - Minimal effects on unrelated facts: <5% affected
   - Possible downstream degradation with multiple edits

Resources Ready for Experimentation:
- EasyEdit framework in code/easyedit/
- CounterFact dataset (21,919 records) in datasets/
- 28 relevant papers in papers/
- Comprehensive literature review in literature_review.md
